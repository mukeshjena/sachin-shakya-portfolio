# Agent Memory Log — Sachin Shakya Portfolio Site

> **Append-only.** Never delete or edit previous entries.
> Every agent session that performs work MUST add a new dated entry at the bottom.
> This file is the primary defence against context loss across chat sessions.

## 2026-09-18 — Step 1: Toolchain & Project Bootstrap (Completed ✅)

**Branch:** `step/01-toolchain-bootstrap` → merged into `main`
**Commit:** `ae253c6 feat(step-01): toolchain bootstrap — Vite+React+TS+TailwindV4+Biome+PWA`

**What was done:**
- Scaffolded Vite 8 + React 19 + TypeScript 6 project into the repo root
- Installed and configured Tailwind CSS v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin (no `tailwind.config.ts` needed for v4, config embedded in CSS)
- Installed Biome v2.5.14 (replaced oxlint from scaffold); ran `biome migrate --write` to align with v2.5.14 schema
- Installed `vite-plugin-pwa` — manifest placeholder in `vite.config.ts`, icons deferred to Step 26
- Installed `vite-plugin-react` for Fast Refresh
- Cleaned all Vite boilerplate: removed `src/assets/`, `src/App.css`, `.oxlintrc.json`
- Created `src/index.css` with Tailwind v4 import + initial instrument-panel palette tokens
- Created minimal `src/App.tsx` (placeholder) and `src/main.tsx` (under 15 lines)
- Created `.env.example` with all Firebase + Cloudinary + Cloudflare + app keys (blanked)
- Updated `package.json`: renamed to `sachin-shakya-portfolio`, added `check`/`check:fix`/`format`/`seed`/`cleanup` scripts
- `code.old/` preserved: `index.html` (reference design) + `Sachin_Shakya_Resume.pdf`

**Verification:**
- `npm run build` → ✅ 315ms build, TypeScript strict mode passed
- `npx biome check .` → ✅ 10 files, 0 errors after auto-fix
- PWA: `dist/sw.js` + `dist/workbox-*.js` generated

**Key decisions:**
- Tailwind v4 uses `@import "tailwindcss"` in CSS — no JS config file needed
- Biome v2.5.14 uses `"preset": "recommended"` not `"recommended": true`
- `organizeImports` moved to `assist.actions.source.organizeImports` in Biome v2
- `code.old/` and `doc/` excluded from Biome checks via `files.includes`

## 2026-09-18 — Step 2: .gitignore, .agent/ Memory System, Strict Rules File (Completed ✅)

**Branch:** `step/02-agent-memory-rules` → merged into `main`

**What was done:**
- Enhanced `.gitignore`: added `.env`/`.env.*` (with `!.env.example` carve-out), `.wrangler`, `*.tsbuildinfo`, `Thumbs.db`
- Created `.agent/agent.md`: 12 non-negotiable rules, full design token table, Clean Architecture constraints, reference path table, per-step workflow protocol
- Created `.agent/memory.md` (this file): append-only session log seeded with Step 1 + Step 2 entries

**Key decisions:**
- `.agent/` folder committed to git so any agent in any future session can read the rules
- `memory.md` is append-only by convention — never edit past entries, only add new dated blocks
- All 12 client rules are numbered and cross-referenced to plan document rule numbers where applicable
